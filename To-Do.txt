While inserting new customer | Error : TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting | line 236
Soon after taking loan, balance is not updated in the UI


@HRIDAY If you get any idea or have any siggestions, add them here under suggestions/ideas and I will implement them. 

--> Complete the code for loan in customer.py
--> Check in defaulters list before making a transaction
--> Add a confirm password step in customer.py if possible
--> Start with admin.py
